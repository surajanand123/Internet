        <p><b>1. Write HTML code that shows the following text.</b></p>
        <p><b>Theorem:</b> Every prime number (greater than 2)<em> modulo</em> 4 can be written in the form<em> 4n + 1</em> or<em> 4n + 3.</em></p>
        <p><b>Proof:</b> Any number p when divided by 4 leaves remainder 0, 1, 2 or 3. Therefore, the number has the form<em> 4n, 4n + 1, 4n + 2 or 4n + 3.</em> Since<em> 4n </em>and <em> 4n + 2</em> are<br><strong>even,</strong> so these can not be a form of a prime number which is an<strong> odd</strong> number (except 2). This proves the theorem. &#9744;</p>

    <h1>Solving Equations in Two Variables with Python</h1>
    <p>An equation is said to be linear equation in two variables if it is written in the form of ax + by + c=0, where a, b & c are real numbers and the coefficients of x and y,<br> i.e a and b respectively, are not equal to zero.<br>
    
    For example, 10x+4y = 3 and -x+5y = 2 are linear equations in two variables.
    The solution for such an equation is a pair of values, one for x and one for y which<br> further makes the two sides of an equation equal.</p>
    
    <p>The solution of linear equations in two variables, ax+by = c, is a particular point in the graph, such that when x-coordinate is multiplied by a and y-coordinate<br> is multiplied by b, then the sum of these two values will be equal to c. 
    Basically, for linear equation in two variables,<br> there are infinitely many solutions.</p>
    
    <p>Understanding how to solve equations in two variables is an important skill in algebra. Let's go through the process step by step and then implement a simple Python<br>
         program to solve such equations.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Identify the Equations:</strong> Start with a system of two equations in the form (ax + by = c).</li>
        <li><strong>Select a Method:</strong> There are various methods to solve such systems. Here, we'll focus on substitution.</li>
        <li><strong>Solve for One Variable:</strong> Choose one equation and solve it for one variable in terms of the other.</li>
        <li><strong>Substitute:</strong> Substitute the expression obtained in the previous step into the other equation.</li>
        <li><strong>Solve:</strong> Solve the resulting equation to find the value of the variable.</li>
        <li><strong>Back-Substitute:</strong> Substitute the found value back into one of the original equations to find the other variable.</li>
        <li><strong>Verify:</strong> Verify the solution by checking it in both original equations.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Example:</h2>

    <p>Consider the following system of equations:</p>

    <p class="equation">
        <em>(2x + y = 5)<br>
        (3x - 2y = 8)</em>
    </p>

    <p>Choose the first equation and solve for y:</p>

    <p class="equation">
        <em>(2x + y = 5)<br>
        (y = 5 - 2x)</em>
    </p>

    <p>Substitute <em>(y = 5 - 2x)</em> into the second equation:</p>

    <p class="equation">
        <em>((3x - 2(5 - 2x)) = 8)</em>
    </p>

    <p>Solving for x gives <em>(x = 2)</em>. Substitute <em>(x = 2)</em> back into the expression for y: <em>(x = 1).</em></p>

    <p class="equation">
        <em>(2(2) + y = 5)</em>
    </p>

    <p>Solving for y, we get <em>(y = 1).</em> So, the solution to the system is <em>(x = 2)</em> and <em>(y = 1).</em></p>
    
    <h2>Python Program:</h2>

    <p>Now, let's implement a Python program that solves equations in two variables:</p>

    <pre>
        <code class="python">
            # Coefficients
            a1, b1, c1 = 2, 1, 5
            a2, b2, c2 = 3, -2, 8

            # Solve for y in terms of x
            y_in_terms_of_x = c1 - a1 * x

            # Substitute y_in_terms_of_x into the second equation
            equation = a2 * x + b2 * y_in_terms_of_x - c2

            # Solve the resulting equation for x
            solution_x = equation / (a2 + b2)

            # Substitute x back into y_in_terms_of_x to find y
            solution_y = y_in_terms_of_x.subs(x, solution_x)

            # Verify the solution by checking it in both equations
            check1 = a1 * solution_x + b1 * solution_y == c1
            check2 = a2 * solution_x + b2 * solution_y == c2

            print("Solution:", solution_x, solution_y)
            print("Verification:", check1 and check2)
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>This Python program is a basic example. In real-world scenarios, consider using specialized libraries or more robust methods for solving equations.</p>
